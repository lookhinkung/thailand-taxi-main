                    <h3>Why, Thailand Taxi Transfer Service offers more premiums than regular taxis?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beginning the taxi services in 1991 with a Volvo sedan 740-760 up to 960 do private transfer service for tourists from Bangkok/Don Muang International Airport to any destination around Thailand and after 12 years we switched to use a Toyota Japanese car like Camry sedan, Fortuner SUV, Innova MPV and Minibus VAN. Because, it's almost the same performance but easier maintenance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore it is commonly used for transportation services for tourists and passengers who wants comfort and privacy than regular taxis. 
                    </p>
